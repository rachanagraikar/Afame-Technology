                <h1>Facial Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning</h1>
                <p>This project is a *Final Year Engineering Project (2023)* designed to explore and implement *Facial Emotion Recognition (FER)* using *Deep Learning* techniques. The system uses *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)* to detect and classify facial expressions from images into predefined emotion categories such as *happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust,* and *neutral*.</p>
                <p>Emotion recognition from facial expressions is a significant challenge and an exciting field in artificial intelligence. It has applications in several domains like human-computer interaction, healthcare, and security systems. The ability to detect human emotions based on facial expressions helps machines to interact more naturally and empathetically with humans.</p>
                <p>This project focuses on training a *CNN-based model* on a well-known dataset, FER-2013, and achieving high accuracy in emotion classification. The primary goal is to implement and test a deep learning model that can predict emotions in real-time using live webcam inputs or static images.</p>
