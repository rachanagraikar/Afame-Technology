                <h1>Blog Application Using Spring Boot and ReactJS</h1>
                <p>This project was developed during my <strong>Java Full Stack Development Course</strong> at <strong>ExcelR</strong>. The Blog Application showcases my expertise in building modern, full-stack web applications with <strong>Spring Boot</strong> for the backend and <strong>ReactJS</strong> for the frontend.</p>
                <p>The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for blogs. It supports features like user authentication, category-based blog organization, and a responsive design. The backend leverages <strong>Spring Boot</strong> for building RESTful APIs, while the frontend, powered by <strong>ReactJS</strong>, provides an interactive user interface.</p>
                <p>In this project, I used <strong>MySQL</strong> as the database to store user and blog data securely. The application is scalable, making it suitable for deploying as a personal or community blog platform. This hands-on project solidified my skills in full-stack development and demonstrated best practices for integrating backend and frontend technologies seamlessly.</p>
