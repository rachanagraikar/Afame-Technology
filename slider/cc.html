                <h1>Certification Management System</h1>
                <p>This project was my <strong>Mini Project</strong> during the <strong>5th Semester</strong> of Engineering. The *Certification Management System* was designed to streamline the process of issuing and managing certificates for students completing various courses or events within an educational institution.</p>
                <p>The system automates the generation and storage of certificates, reducing paperwork and manual intervention. Built using <strong>Django</strong> as the backend framework, the system ensures robust and secure server-side operations. The frontend interface was designed with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, ensuring an interactive and user-friendly experience.</p>
                <p>This project utilizes a relational database implemented with <strong>MySQL</strong> to efficiently manage student and course records. It supports real-time certificate generation, verification, and retrieval, ensuring scalability and ease of use. The project demonstrated the integration of backend and frontend technologies to solve a practical problem in an academic setting.</p>

                <h2>Key Learning Outcomes</h2>
                <p>Through this mini project, I gained a solid understanding of <strong>backend development</strong> using Django, the importance of database normalization for managing data, and the principles of creating interactive front-end applications. It was a stepping stone to understanding full-stack development and project lifecycle management.</p>
