                <h1>Air Quality Prediction Using CNN</h1>
                <p>This project is part of my <strong>Internship (2022)</strong>, focusing on <strong>Artificial Intelligence using PyTorch</strong>, conducted at <strong>Ekathva Innovation, Shimoga</strong>. It leverages the power of <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong> to analyze air quality data and predict pollutant levels effectively.</p>
                <p>The primary goal of this project was to develop an AI model capable of predicting air quality metrics like <strong>PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2,</strong> and more using historical data and real-time inputs. This system can assist urban planners, environmentalists, and governments in mitigating air pollution and taking proactive measures to improve air quality.</p>
                <p>The project involved processing large datasets, feature extraction, and model training using PyTorch, achieving high prediction accuracy. The trained CNN model demonstrates the capability to classify air quality into predefined categories (e.g., Good, Moderate, Poor) based on the pollutants' levels.</p>
